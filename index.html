            Hi, my name is Nikki, and welcome to my personal profile that I built from scratch! Thank you for taking some time to learn more about me.<br><br>
            I was first introduced to programming in high school, when I went to the programming club at lunch breaks. During the 45 minutes meeting we had every week, 
            I found my passion for computers and programming. I have been studying computer science at the University of British Columbia
            in Vancouver, Canada, and I could not have been happier with my decision to major and learn more about softwares and computers.<br>
            In the past years, I have been working on personal projects, attending hackathons, and gaining work experience through internships.
            I will talk more about them in the next sections.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my spare time, I like to work on my side projects, take part in a hackathon, or attend the Turing club at UBC in which I learn more about AI and ML during winter semesters.
            Furthermore, I also enjoy to volunteer at different organizations, run and practice yoga, read books, meet up with friends and go for a hike.

                &nbsp; For example, I have been able to learn more able test automation, and working on customer issues<br> and bug fixes.<br>
                &nbsp; On the other hand, I have been able to work more on my ability to talk in a group, and ask for <br>clarifications and help when I am stuck.<br>
                &nbsp; A challenge that I was able to overcome was to communicate effectively with my team while working<br>from home by scheduling meetings and being more mindful of other people's schedule.<br>
                &nbsp; Furthermore, I have been able to learn from my peers and other developers through code reviews,<br>sprints, and knowledge transfer sessions.<br>

              Not only I have been able to strengthen my knowledge in softwares and programming by teaching students, 
              but I have also been able to practice to be more patient when I am <br> explaining harder concepts and their applications, such as hashmaps.<br>
              &nbsp; Lastly, I learned much more about debugging other people's code, and troubleshooting and resolving problems.

              &nbsp; One of the main skills that I was able to learn was working in a group and contributing as a<br> developer to 
              a project. It was extremely insightful to learn more about working on a software's feature <br>from end to end, and the different stages of a project,
              from elaboration to code review and release.<br>
              &nbsp; Moreover, I was able to fullfil one of my main learning goals during my time at the company, 
              which<br> was to be able to ask questions when I need to, and learn from my mentors and the<br> 
              full-time employees about best programming practices.</p>

          &nbsp; Working on projects have been a very fun hobby that I picked up. From the very beginning, I have been 
          very interested in backend programming, and coming up with algorithms that can help a user.
          Being able to handle a big amount of data, analyzing it, and getting information from it has been 
          something that I enjoyed a lot for the past couple of years. 
          <br>
          &nbsp; During winter time, I usually look forward to hackathons coming up. I enjoy hackthon events because of 
          I am able to learn a lot regarding both teamwork and programming, work in a team and have a finalized project
          in 24 hours, and get inspired by my peers and mentors. 
          <br>
          &nbsp; I usually work on projects that help me solve a problem in my life, learn more about a framework, 
          and solidify my knowledge in data structures and programming. In the project I have highlighted below, I will 
          go more in depth in my latest project which contains all the elements mentioned above.

            <b>June 2020 - Current</b> <br>
            <i>Technology: Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, NewsAPI, MS Azure Cognitive Systems, MongoDB, IBM Watson</i><br><br>
            &nbsp; From the beginning of 2020, I would've gotten surprised a few times a month by the news. For example, 
            when the news about Yemen humanitarian crisis came out, I was very dissapointed that I had no idea about it happening 
            until the situation became a world wide news. After that, I tried to follow the news more often, but the problem that came up
            was that learning about the news happening in every country was very time consuming, and translating the news to English was a big problem.
            That is when I came up with the idea of NewsSummarizer.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; In the project NewsSummarizer, I pull news from all around the world every 12 hours, and translate it using MSAzure to a user-input language.
            I came up with an algorithm in which the news gets summarized into 5 sentences or less, and commit the sentences and other informations
            about it in MongoDB noSQL database to use in the frontend. Furthermore, I am also analyzing the tone of the news using IBM Watson in order
             to give the user a general knowledge of the news.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; Currently, I am done with the BackEnd of my website, and I am working on the FrontEnd to display the results to the user.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp; Using my project, I have already been more up to date on the news around the world, without having to spend hours on looking 
            up different news sources and reading more about what's happening in the world.

            <b>February 2019</b> <br>
            During XdHacks 2019, I worked in a group of 4 to develop a website in 24 hours.<br><br> I was responsible for implementing fuctions to call
            Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services (Text Analysis) to get an analysis of the bias and the tone (sentiment) of the world's news.
            We were able to get the news headlines and bodies by parsing Google News API. <br><br>
            After finishing my work, I helped my teammates with building a website to display the results, and color each country different
            based on the average of their sentiment value.
